# classification-of-x-ray-images-using-grid-approach

*** Group 21 Image Processing Lab IIT Kharagpur 2021 ***


1. Create a console app and extract contents of "Project-Gr-21" into the source files.

2. For viewing the transformations on any test image build the "GridTransform.cpp" only. </br>
	a. input the file number from the displayed list </br>
	b. you can see all the stages of transformation sequentially

3. For classifying the test images into classes build and run the "x-ray-classification.cpp" only.</br>
	a. You can see the freeman codes of all input images in the console</br>
	b. 5 different class folders will be created and the test images will be stored into them automatically.

4. For testing any new x-ray sample make sure that the xray image is inside a minimum border width(margin).
